    <h1>Shopping Cart Prototype</h1>
    <p>This is just a little shopping cart prototype I threw together. No big deal. Some of the problems I explored included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do they add an item to their cart?</li>
      <li>How do they  their shipping info?</li>
      <li>How will they know that they succeeded?</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
